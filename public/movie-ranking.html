<h1>The Best Movies According to Vassilis</h1>
<h2>My top movie of all-time</h2>


<hr />


<h3>Interstellar</h3>


<p>This movie is my favorite because, no matter how many times I've seen it,
Every time, it gives me a new perspective and a new way of thinking.
It broadens my horizons. </p>


<h3>Drive</h3>


<p>The way of thinking and the interpretation of the hero of the film
somehow reminds me of my own temperament. Maybe because I'm a Scorpio too.
ha ha. </p>


<h3>Webdev the Great (season 1)</h3>


<p>is a film based on a true story about a young boy (40 years old).
yoga teacher and fitness coach who decided to change careers and deal
with programming and, more specifically, with data science. He has a strong
will, patience, and a clear mind, but he has almost zero knowledge.
The first season shows us his first steps, his searches, and his concerns.
and how he tries to find the right way to fulfill his dream in a funny way.
In the first episodes, there is a lot of laughter since his introduction.
Programming is like driving the "Enterprise" from Star Wars by himself.
Luckily for him, his first teacher, Angela, took all the stress and weight off his shoulders.
off his shoulders, and now he is trying to finish his first course about
web development. Stay tuned. ha ha. </p>
